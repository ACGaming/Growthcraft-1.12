-----------------
To discuss:
-----------------
DONE: * Maximal 8 cheese stages? -> Needed to encode stage and cheese type in item meta.
=> DECISSION: Using 4 cheese stages. [Discord:general, 14.01.2017]

-----------------
To implement:
-----------------
TODO: Rope bounding boxes are not reacting according neighbor blocks.
TODO: Step sound of apple fences should be changed to wood.
TODO: Refactoring: Change Item and Block types to GC.Core types. Especially food types.
DONE: Change Grape blocks from BlockCrops to BlockBush

-----------------
Bugs:
-----------------
BUG: Thistle recipe not working to get seeds.
BUG: Ricotta bowl recipe not working.
BUG: Cheese press is triggered when placing a neighbor block.
BUG: Effect duration in Detail window appears to be wrong. E.g. for Skim Milk. 
BUG: Filling bottles with booze bucket always returning juice. Reason: NBTtags of UniversalBucket in class ShapelessRecipes not compared. 
BUG: Collision boxes for brewing kettle walls are not correct.
BUG: No kind of block sounds, like fruit press pistons, splash sound when dropping items into brewing kettle a.s.o.
BUG: Fix string formatting with arguments when logging.
DONE: Grape Leaves are removed, too, if a trunk has been removed.
DONE: Cheese rotation needs to be fixed.
DONE: BUG: Tipsy Effect not saved when game is saved.
DONE: BUG: No Tipsy Effect icon. 
NOTABUG: BUG: Booze color is too dark.

-----------------
Potential Bugs:
-----------------
TODO: INVESTIGATED: ShouldRefresh = false for all device tile entities. Sometimes block states are changed and a recreation of tile entity is to be avoided. 
* Bugs are expected on block state changes, e.g. for fruit presser and if blocks are rotated.

-----------------
